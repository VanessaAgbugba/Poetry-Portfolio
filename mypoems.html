            <p>Do not tell me you understand <br> You have never known true torment <br> Unless you have fallen to your knees <br> And prayed to die <br> Be quiet <br> And do not preach the sermon of heartache <br> Until the day you bite your lip hard enough
                for it to bleed <br> So the walls do not hear you cry <br> Stop yourself from speaking of suffering my dear <br> You have never hurt so much <br> That you could not stop trembling <br> Still you cry out that you have known pain <br> Have
                you ever died but stayed awake <br> Body alive Yet soul in the grave

            <p>I know a story of an abandoned few <br> They carry the wind in their spirit <br> And worship love with all their might <br> Yet destiny has chosen to steal from them <br> The only thing they have ever craved <br> For no matter how many prayers
                gush from their lips <br> Like shadows they must roam the world <br> Never going unnoticed <br> But perpetually ignored <br> And of the abandoned I am the youngest one <br> Still my tears brought no mercy <br> So let our Father's will
                be done <br> Tell our hearts not to pity us <br> Though we are bleeding <br> We are strong <br> I have held their hands <br> And with courage we accept your curse <br> It is a pity that the children of love <br> Will never be loved

            <p>No one will ever know how painful it is <br> To write on these pages <br> What do you do when your heart is cut out of you <br> Tell me how one is supposed to heal <br> When pain grows fond of you <br> There is no one for me here <br> Every
                door is a potential gateway to hell <br> So i choose to spend my days with the only loves that will never leave me <br> I will find comfort in the paper pages <br> And the love of my life <br> Will live in my imagination <br> For even
                though my skin will never know another caress <br> At least my wounded heart <br> At last Will rest

                emotion <br> As innocent as a new born’s first cry <br> Died with the final words <br> Of the crucified Christ <br> The last man whose heart had known real love <br> So darling if you seek to find such love again <br> Make sure your heart
                is unafraid of pain <br> For the people of your world my child <br> Have grown too fond of playing games <br>

            <p>I remember when my greatest wish was to grace your shores, America <br> To stand on your soil and scream away the air from my lungs shouting <br> Atlast, I am here, America <br> With eager heart and joyous spirit I explored you <br> Anxiously
                awaiting the fulfillment of my American dream <br> Alas, eleven months of self education tore away the scales from my eyes <br> Shards of my dream America burying themselves deep in my bleeding palms <br> So i ask, hurt and betrayed <br>                Why did you hide your true colors, America <br> Why did you not tell me the soil I stepped on was soaked in blood <br> You stole my brothers and sisters, America <br> You massaged the ears of hopeful parents with false promises

            <p>Time wonders past me and I begin to dream of things beyond my reach <br> Paper and ink have never failed me <br> My emotions come to life on blank pages <br> Yet for so long I betrayed my source of refuge <br> And allowed the demons dance
                within me <br> Look closer and find a thousand cuts decorating my body <br> The moon peaks through my window and joins me in mourning <br> There is agony coursing through me <br> Let the world stop for a moment so I can find rest
                <br> I want to go back to the days I suckled on my mother’s breast <br> Because this world where only the guilty triumph <br> Devours the innocent <br> I feel my spirit failing as my body turns cold <br> You will forever drown in sorrow
                <br> If you keep that heart of gold <br>

            <p>Some moments are meant to be still and quiet <br> For sometimes words only cause the wound to bleed <br> Hold me tight in your embrace <br> Do not try to wipe my tear streaked face <br> Let the salt water flow down my face to release the pain
                <br> Let my body in your arms <br> Quiver and shake <br> Sometimes your voice is too painful to hear <br> But those eyes full of concern <br> That embrace strong and bringing life to me like air <br> Gives me the courage to walk the lonely
                road <br> Out of my fears

                <br> Like dust from a sandstorm <br> The broken pieces of her heart have pierced through her soul <br> So while she lays there waiting <br> To be sentenced to perpetual damnation <br> Heaven will have mercy <br> Because blood dripping
                from her wrist like liquid salvation <br> Was the only thing that brought her peace <br>

                to listen to the voices in your head <br> Telling you to fight <br> You ate from the same plate as the devil <br> And he fed you his lies <br> They’ve sucked the strength away from your bones <br> They have left you scared and blind <br>                But I will not cast the first stone <br> Because at that table I too did dine <br> There is no need to weep or cry <br> For deep within your heart <br> You know your only purpose <br> Was to be born and then die

            <p> I feel like I belong here <br> Chained hand and foot to this bed <br> While staring back and forth at my companions <br> Bonding over our grief and forgotten hopes <br> I felt the sun on my face today <br> I had forgotten what it felt like
                to feel anything <br> Being locked up here with the fallen and downtrodden <br> Gave me more satisfaction than mere sun rays <br> We all hold hands here <br> In our minds of course <br> And tell our stories <br> Never moving our lips and
                yet conveying the tales of our woes <br> With our eyes, our tears, and occasional whimpers <br> Feeling our anguish in a frightening uniformity <br> Absurd in the eyes of outsiders <br> But a blissful escape to us

            <h2>Untitled </h2>
            <p>It takes over you without warning <br> Suddenly nothing else makes you smile so widely <br> One single person becomes your everything <br> Then happiness begins to swell in your heart and fill every crack <br> Making you feel at peace and
                drunk on pure ecstacy <br> This is the part of love I like the most <br> When your chest tightens <br> As the butterflies in your stomach flutter faster and faster <br> When they are all you see <br> And a future without them in it seems
                unimaginable <br> Cherish this part of love <br> Before the ills of the world come to poison it

            <p>Because you have my heart wrapped around your finger <br> Like an earthworm to a pole <br> That is why you take the weight on my love on your shoulders for granted <br> Tonight though while i wait to hear the absence of your knock on my door
                <br> I choose not to cry for myself <br> But to shed bitter tears for the life of someone else <br> I have watched you question the meaning of love <br> While i stood naked in front of you <br> The scales in your eyes were too thick to
                recognize <br> That i i was love in human form <br> Every section of my heart is a page that bears your name <br> Not a single part of my being after meeting you <br> Has been left unscathed, You have marked me <br> Even though unintentionally
                <br> I see the darkness in your eyes <br> While others run and hide, I dive deeper into you <br> For I am not too afraid to roam the dark <br> To seek out the light

            <p>There’s probably another soul out there that’s just like mine <br> Patiently waiting in the dark to be noticed <br> But your limelight is too bright <br> Its shining in your eyes so much that it blinds you <br> The audience is cheering too
                loudly and it deafens you <br> I try to call out to you but my efforts are useless <br> Even when each scream takes all the air out of my lungs <br> What will happen when the encore is over <br> And one by one they leave the room <br>                Will you recognise that one being who stayed behind <br> Or will you leave the stage <br> As oblivious as you were of the first soul <br> The same soul that walked in <br> Before the first note of your solo played

            <p>I can see my children’s bodies in my dreams <br> Tear streaked faces, quivering lips and bloodshot eyes <br> The dark clouds hovering above them <br> Pregnant with the rain of my mistakes <br> They cry out for me <br> But I am too deaf to
                their calls <br> And too blind to see their pain <br> Cloaked in my own hardships <br> I walk farther and farther <br> Away from the ones whom I live for <br> Till I fall into the welcoming arms of death's beloved angels

            <p>We walk together in comfortable silence <br> Content and ignorant of the world around us <br> So lost are we in our own realm <br> That we gift former strangers our hearts <br> Giving them up freely, unguarded, and yearning to be loved <br>                Now we begin to yield too easily <br> And cry too often <br> We know the source of our despair <br> Yet we continue to drink from its well <br> Drowning ourselves in a disease we are too fond of <br> To seek healing from <br> There is
                no hope for the likes of us <br> For helpless are those who fall in love

            <p>The next time you dream of me <br> It will bring tears to your eyes <br> The medicine bottle is empty <br> And the ground is littered with broken glass <br> As beautiful as shattered ice <br> Tell them when you sit before my wooden chamber
                <br> That i would love my favourite songs to be played <br> And to be dressed in a royal blue dress <br> Embellished with strips of rich lace <br> Bring a simple honorary bouquet <br> And you will see my smiling face <br> All gathered
                will feel my presence <br> For i was the love that was always true <br> And all though i roam no more <br> A piece of me will remain forever <br> Dwelling in all of you

            <p> It surprises you to find out <br> That the love you feel around you is a mirage <br> How many times will you light up a flame in high hopes <br> Only to watch the cold wind of loneliness erase it from existence <br> A heavy heart will do you
                no good <br> It is the way of the world <br> To surround you with many <br> But in the blink of an eye the warmth you feel evaporates <br> The dream is over <br> The shadows are lost in the morning sun <br> Yet it feels so cold

            <p>Fire and ice were never meant to mix <br> But i would cry along with you <br> At the sight of your red eyes <br> Your evil would not let my love fade <br> My wounds could be reopened a thousand times <br> And i would bleed blood and water
                <br> But still stay <br> If i could bathe in a cauldron of fire to ease your pain <br> I would wallow there for an eternity <br> If only to stop a tear from flowing down your face <br> I do not love like the rest of the world <br> I’d
                cherish you more than i cherished myself <br> The thought of your discomfort would feel worse than hell <br> Still the world’s love is shallow and dead <br> So tell me where will i find a love that is heaven sent <br> On earth
